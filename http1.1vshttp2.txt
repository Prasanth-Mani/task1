Intro:
     As the backbone of the web, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is essential for transferring data between clients and servers.

 1. Multiplexing:
             http1.1 - In HTTP/1.1, multiple requests and responses are sent over a single connection, but only one request can be processed at a time.

             http2 - HTTP/2 introduces multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent simultaneously over a single connection.

 2. Connection Management:
              http1.1 - HTTP/1.1 requires multiple connections for optimal performance, which can lead to increased latency and resource consumption on both the client and server sides.           

              http2 - HTTP/2 reduces the number of connections needed by allowing multiple streams over a single connection.


       Conclusion:       
                As web developers, understanding these differences is crucial for optimizing website performance and ensuring a seamless experience for users. If you havenâ€™t yet made the switch to HTTP/2, now is the time to consider the benefits it offers for your projects.
